# Medical-Assistance-System
Medical Assistance System (MAS) is an end user support project. We propose a system that connects specialized and available doctor and local medical stores with the users/patients. MAS aims to build an environment where various patients needing doctor's help can contact doctor and get appointment or order medicines from nearest medical store right from the application. It consists of doctor's, patient's and medical store owner's login panel. Doctors may login to the system and can see patients for consultation and medical store owner may login to the system to see the patient's requests for medicines to be delivered at their doorsteps.
